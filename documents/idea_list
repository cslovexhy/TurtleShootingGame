- Enemy Visibility (done)
    * Just like dungeon, chase player to death once player is on their radar. (done)
    * [stretch goal] group alert scheme (we don't even have group defined yet) (sort of done, two ways of aggro: pull and hit)
- Easier Player Enemy Placement (done)
    * Add MapDefinition class and move WALL_LAY_OUT_LEVEL_1 in.
    * Use 'P' for player and '0' - '9' for enemy to initialize player and enemies.
- Design some interesting levels.
    * Home (done)
    * 6 block (done)
    * training ground
- More item dropping
    * consumable item pickup logic (done)
    * attack + 1 item (done)
    * defense + 1 item (done)
    * equipment definition and pickup logic
    * sword + X attack
    * armor + X defense
    * shoe + X speed
    * skill item effect piling (1st one give base count, 2nd one and on increase the same skill's power, such as shard count or conversion rate increase, write a function "increase_power" for each skill class)

Not sure:
- Player visibility & Fog? [aborted because of performance/UX issue]
