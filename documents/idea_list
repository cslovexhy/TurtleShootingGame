- Enemy Visibility (done)
    * Just like dungeon, chase player to death once player is on their radar. (done)
    * [stretch goal] group alert scheme (we don't even have group defined yet) (sort of done, two ways of aggro: pull and hit)
- Easier Player Enemy Placement (done)
    * Add MapDefinition class and move WALL_LAY_OUT_LEVEL_1 in.
    * Use 'P' for player and '0' - '9' for enemy to initialize player and enemies.
- Design some interesting levels.

Not sure:
- Player visibility & Fog?
